# Number Complement

Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.


Example 1:

Input: num = 5<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.<br>

Example 2:<br>

Input: num = 1<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.<br>
 

Constraints:
<ul>
<li>The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.</li><br>
<li>num >= 1</li><br>
<li>You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.</li>
</ul>
