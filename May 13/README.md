# Remove K Digits

Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:<br>
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.<br>
The given num does not contain any leading zero.<br>

Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3<br>
Output: "1219"<br>
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

Example 2:

Input: num = "10200", k = 1<br>
Output: "200"<br>
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

Example 3:

Input: num = "10", k = 2<br>
Output: "0"<br>
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
